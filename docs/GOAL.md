Crypt of the NecroDancer (Cadences of Hyrule) clone in Godot 4.

- 1 [[LEVEL]] (with boss fight at the end)
	- 3 types of [[ENEMIES]] (+ boss)


Assets:
- me: 
	- [[VFX]] sprites + effects (SpriteMancer + Aseprite)

- other:
	- music
	- sprites (Itch.io)(possibly do my own later)


## TODO:
- check audio latency (calibrate)

IF I HAVE TIME:
- more weapons: spear that can attack two spaces in front of you (instead of the daggerâ€™s one space), or the wide sword that can attack three adjacent spaces in front of you (allowing you to hit multiple enemies at once)
- shop system ([[ENEMIES]] drop coins)
